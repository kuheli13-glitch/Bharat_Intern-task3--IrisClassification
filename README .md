This is a simple classification task performed on the Iris dataset - one of the best known dataset in the world of data science.
## Motivation
I am definitely not a flower expert, but with the help of a dataset with 150 iris instances with their petal and sepal measurements, can I be one? Also which of the petal/sepal measurements are more useful features to look at for better understanding?
